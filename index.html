							<P>As Data Analyst for Udemy, I was asked by management of Udemy to show the data on course revenue to understand and
							identify opportunities to increase sales/revenue, monitor how well the different courses are doing and to find out which
							is the most popular among the courses.
							I have closely look at consumer subscription trends gotten from Udemy between the years 2011 and 2017 considering four
							(4) different subject areas. The data was adjusted for duplicates, blank cells and inconsistent data adjusted using
							google sheets. The clean data was analyzed using google sheet to create necessary visuals. The aims of study
							are to identify possible revenue increase opportunities and track performance on the following topics; Web Development,
							Graphic Design, Business Finance, and Musical Instruments.
							RESULT/CONCLUSION
							1.The provided data shows that Web Development is the most popular of all the subjects and also provided the highest
							sales/revenue.
